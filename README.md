# GenerativeArt_NFT
played around with Samila, which is a package and an application.

Samila is a generative art generator written in Python. Samila lets you create images based on many thousands of points. The position of every single point is calculated by a formula that has random parameters. Because of the random numbers, every image looks different.


Lessons learned: You shouldn't run untrusted code as sudo.
